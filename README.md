# Laravel + React Starter Kit

## Introduction

The Laravel React starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com). This starter kit includes modern tooling and dependency fixes that resolve common installation and build issues.

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page React applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This gives you the frontend power of React combined with Laravel's exceptional backend productivity and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This React starter kit utilizes React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com) component libraries.

## ✨ What's Fixed

This starter kit resolves critical issues that prevent successful installation and development:

- ✅ **Dependency Conflicts**: Fixed npm ERESOLVE conflicts and mixed React versions
- ✅ **ESLint Configuration**: Updated to modern flat config approach  
- ✅ **Build System**: Resolved Tailwind v4 and PostCSS configuration issues
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Fixed compilation errors and case sensitivity problems
- ✅ **Missing Files**: Added required bootstrap file and proper configuration
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Tested and verified for production deployment
